# Street-Ball
We are implementing a simple game with assembly 8086 

We are planning to implement the game with 2 modes 
first mode is a football mode: the 2 players can move and jump to be the first to surf the ball and score goals when you throw the ball in your opponent's goal
second mode is a volleyball mode: each player will have a side of the field to play and can't enter the opponent's side, the ball will be restarted in the player's side who scored the previous goal, scoring goal by letting the ball touches the opponent's territory
